 <p>Minecraft is a very popular survival video game. Of course, it's not just about survival.
 You can play in survival mode, or creative mode. Creative allows you to enjoy your minecraft world, 
 or you can roleplay freely without any monsters ruining it for you. Survival mode is more realistic.
 (Kind of.) In survival mode you can't fly around exploring the world like in Creative.
 You are on a mission to defeat the ender dragon. You have to face dangerous obstacles like
the zombies and skeletons trying to kill you, or having to find armor and weapons to fight the
monsters off. Not only that, you have to find food, try not to take fall damage, and even go mining in a cave.
Although there are tough obstacles, it's really fun. You can even code it so that you can have fun challenges
that you can do solo or with friends. You can even become a Minecraft youtuber! There are a lot of very famous 
minecraft youtubers like the Dream SMP (Dream, Georgenotfound, Tubbo, Tommyinnet, etc.) 
Minecraft is a very famous and fun game. </p>
