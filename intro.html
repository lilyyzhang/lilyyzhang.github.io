Hi! My name is Lily Zhang. I am taking programming class in the semester of spring 2022. This is my second semester of taking programming class. I am a student at Coventry Elementary School (CES) If you go there then you might find me in Ms. Marquis' class. I also do extend. Extend is a program for kids who aren't being challenged enough at base school. I've been doing extend since kindergarten. My favorite subject is math. I think of it as very easy to learn. I am a black belt in Taekwondo. I've been going ever since I was four years old! I also play piano and take dance classes. I am also an artist. I love to make art and you can find my artwork in the "Artwork" section. I like to spend my open time playing video games like roblox or minecraft. I am a multitasker and I'm good at it. That would be some things you would know about me. I love making friends and making people laugh. That would be my introduction. Byee!
