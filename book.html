<h2>I love a lot of book series. Right now I'm currently reading Warriors.
 Warriors is a series about four clans of cats that live in the wild defending
 for their clans. It's a very interesting series and it's very realistic.(It has some drama too.) </h2>

<h3>Warriors series (Erin Hunter)</h3>
<h3>Whatever After series (Sarah Mlynowsky)</h3>
<h3>Humphrey series (Betty G. Birney) </h3>
<h3>Cam Jansen Series (David A. Adler) </h3>
